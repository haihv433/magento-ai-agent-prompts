## 🤝 Contributions

### For Human Contributors

**Please follow these conventions when contributing:**

#### 📁 Folder Structure
- **`/magento/`** - Core Magento development guidelines and systematic approaches
- **`/prompts/`** - Task-specific instructions for common Magento development scenarios

#### 📝 File Naming Convention
- **Use snake_case lowercase** for all file names
- **Examples**: `design_patterns.md`, `fix_outdated_module_code.md`, `debug_magento_issues.md`
- **Avoid**: `DesignPatterns.md`, `fix-outdated-code.md`, `debugMagentoIssues.md`

#### 📋 Content Guidelines
- **Keep instructions concise** - Reference existing content in `/magento/` folder instead of duplicating
- **Use clear section headers** with emojis for easy navigation
- **Include mandatory reading requirements** when applicable
- **Provide step-by-step workflows** for complex tasks
- **Add validation checklists** before proposing solutions

#### 🔄 Workflow for Adding New Prompts
1. **Identify the task category** (debugging, module development, API, etc.)
2. **Create a new `.md` file** in `/prompts/` using snake_case naming
3. **Reference existing content** in `/magento/` folder rather than duplicating
4. **Follow the established format** with clear sections and workflows
5. **Update this README** if adding new task categories
