## üß≠ AI Tool Workflow

### üö® MANDATORY: AI Tools MUST Follow These Steps in EXACT Order

**Step 1: Repository Setup (Immediate)**
1. **Read this readme.md completely** to understand the repository structure.
2. **üö® IMMEDIATELY read ALL files in [`/ai_instructions/`](./ai_instructions/) folder SIMULTANEOUSLY** (MANDATORY - This gives AI further instructions)

**Step 2: Before ANY Task Execution**
3. **Search the [`/prompts/`](./prompts/) folder** for relevant task instructions:
   - Look for files that match your task
   - If no exact match, find the closest related instruction file
   - Understand how to approach the specific task
4. **Read ALL files in [`/magento/`](./magento/) folder** (MANDATORY - for understanding code logic and structure)

**Step 3: Task Execution**
5. **Clarify requirements** using the requirement clarification process
6. **Read the selected prompt file** and follow its instructions carefully
7. **Execute the task** following the systematic approach outlined in the instructions
8. **Create and manage local storage files** in the magento-ai-agent-prompts repository root:
   - **Environment config**: `env.local.md` for environment settings
   - **Task files**: `{question}.{date-time}.local.md` for task tracking
   - **Never save** local storage files in the Magento project directory

## üö® Critical Instructions for AI Tools

- **ALWAYS follow the mandatory reading requirements** specified in each prompt file
- **NEVER skip instructions** or assume you know the process
- **ALWAYS use the systematic approach** outlined in the magento folder (as reference)
- **ALWAYS use proper labeling** in all responses as specified in ai_instructions
- **ALWAYS create local storage files** in the magento-ai-agent-prompts repository root (NOT in Magento project)

**Remember**: The [`/magento/`](./magento/) folder contains the **reference knowledge** (read-only), and [`/prompts/`](./prompts/) folder contains the **executable task instructions**. Both must be read and followed.
