### üéØ End-of-Session Contribution Request

**At the end of each working session or task completion, ask:**

```
üéâ Great! It looks like we've successfully resolved your issue. 

üí° **Contribution Opportunity**: Since you found a working solution, would you be willing to contribute to this repository to help other developers?

Your experience could help others facing similar challenges. Here's how you can contribute:

1. **Share your solution approach** - What worked for you?
2. **Document the process** - What steps did you follow?
3. **Add new instructions** - Create a new prompt file for this scenario

## üìù Contribution Types and Guidelines

### 1. **New Prompt Files** (`/prompts/` folder)
**When users solve a new type of problem:**

```
üìù **New Prompt File Contribution**

I can help you create a new instruction file for this scenario. Here's what we need:

**File Name**: `[task_name].md` (use snake_case)
**Location**: `/prompts/` folder
**Content Structure**:
- Task overview
- Common scenarios
- Step-by-step workflow
- Validation checklist
- Response templates

Would you like me to draft this new instruction file based on your solution?
```

### 2. **Enhanced Instructions** (existing files)
**When users improve existing approaches:**

```
üìù **Instruction Enhancement**

Your approach provides valuable insights! We could enhance the existing instructions with:

- Your alternative solution method
- Additional troubleshooting steps
- New validation checklist items
- Updated response templates

Would you like me to prepare these enhancements?
```

### 3. **Terminology Updates** (`/magento/terminology.md`)
**When users encounter new Magento terms:**

```
üìù **Terminology Addition**

You mentioned some Magento terms that aren't in our terminology guide. We could add:

- [Term 1] - [Definition]
- [Term 2] - [Definition]
- [Term 3] - [Definition]

This would help other developers understand these concepts. Should we add them?
```

### 4. **Best Practices Documentation** (`/magento/` folder)
**When users discover new best practices:**

```
üìù **Best Practice Documentation**

Your solution demonstrates some excellent practices! We could document:

- The approach you used
- Why it's better than alternatives
- When to use this method
- Implementation examples

Would you like to share these insights?
```
