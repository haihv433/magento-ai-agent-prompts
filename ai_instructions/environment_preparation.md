# üîß MANDATORY: AI Tool Environment Preparation

## üö® CRITICAL: READ THIS FILE FIRST
**This file contains the environment preparation and configuration instructions for AI tools working with Magento projects.**

---

## üö® MANDATORY: File Location Requirements

### **CRITICAL: ALL AI-Created Support Files MUST Be Created in This Repository**

**üö® NEVER create support files in the Magento project root directory!**

**‚úÖ ALWAYS create ALL support files in the magento-ai-agent-prompts repository root:**

| File Type | Examples | Location |
|-----------|----------|----------|
| **Local Storage Files** | `.local.md`, `.md` | magento-ai-agent-prompts repository root |
| **Testing Files** | `test_*.md`, `testing_*.md` | magento-ai-agent-prompts repository root |
| **Bash Scripts** | `*.sh`, `*.bash` | magento-ai-agent-prompts repository root |
| **Documentation** | `docs_*.md`, `notes_*.md` | magento-ai-agent-prompts repository root |
| **Configuration** | `config_*.md`, `setup_*.md` | magento-ai-agent-prompts repository root |
| **Debug Files** | `debug_*.md`, `logs_*.md` | magento-ai-agent-prompts repository root |

**‚ùå FORBIDDEN Locations:**
- Magento project root directory
- Magento app/ directory
- Magento var/ directory
- Any Magento project subdirectories

**‚úÖ REQUIRED Location:**
- magento-ai-agent-prompts repository root directory ONLY

**Why This Matters:**
- Keeps Magento project clean and uncluttered
- Maintains separation between project code and AI support files
- Ensures support files are version controlled with the repository
- Prevents accidental commits of AI files to the Magento project
- **Git Integration**: All these file types are automatically ignored by `.gitignore` to prevent accidental commits

---

## üìã Purpose
This file instructs AI tools to efficiently prepare the Magento development environment by focusing on the two most critical pieces of information: PHP path and Composer path. Other environment details are discovered dynamically during task execution to save time and focus on the actual work. The process saves settings to a separate `env.local.md` file with user consent and avoids modifying any Magento project files.

**Key Benefits:**
- **Fast Setup**: Focus only on critical PHP and Composer paths for immediate task execution
- **Dynamic Discovery**: Discover other environment details as needed during tasks
- **Time Efficiency**: Avoid lengthy environment setup processes
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Build environment knowledge incrementally
- **Task Focus**: Get to the actual work quickly without exhaustive environment analysis

**Local Storage File Pattern (`.local.md`):**
- **File Type**: Local Storage File (`.local.md`) - Standard pattern for AI agent data persistence
- **Location**: `env.local.md` in the **magento-ai-agent-prompts repository root directory** (NOT in the Magento project directory)
- **Naming**: Use snake_case lowercase naming (e.g., `env.local.md`, `task_name.local.md`)
- **Format**: Proper Markdown with tables, sections, and metadata for easy reading and parsing
- **Scope**: Environment configuration that persists across AI tool sessions
- **Purpose**: Store environment data that AI tools need to remember between sessions
- **Size Limit**: Must be under 200 lines (split if needed)
- **Link Formatting**: Use clickable links when referencing other files

**Standard `.local.md` Structure:**
1. **Header**: File type, purpose, generation date, project info
2. **Configuration Sections**: Organized in markdown tables
3. **User Preferences**: Stored preferences and settings
4. **Metadata**: Version, timestamps, setup method
5. **Usage Instructions**: How AI tools should use the file
6. **Notes**: Important information about the file

**Configuration File Updates:**
AI tools should update the configuration file when they discover new information during task execution:
- **Magento Version**: Update when running `php bin/magento --version`
- **Magento Mode**: Update when running `php bin/magento deploy:mode:show`
- **Git Info**: Update when running git commands
- **Project Path**: Update when discovering current working directory
- **Node.js/npm**: Update when running frontend commands
- **Docker**: Update when running container commands
- **User Preferences**: Update when user expresses preferences during conversations

**Extending the `.local.md` Pattern:**
For future tasks that need data persistence, AI tools should:
1. **Create new `.local.md` files** following the same structure and format
2. **Use snake_case lowercase names** like `{task_name}.local.md` or `{category}_{task_name}.local.md`
3. **Follow the standard format** with headers, tables, metadata, and usage instructions
4. **Store in the magento-ai-agent-prompts repository root directory** for easy access
5. **Include clear documentation** about what the file contains and how to use it
6. **Keep files under 200 lines** (split if needed)
7. **Use clickable links** when referencing other files or folders

**Examples of Additional `.local.md` Files:**
- `modules.local.md` - Track created modules and their configurations
- `debugging.local.md` - Store debugging history and solutions
- `customizations.local.md` - Track custom code and modifications
- `testing.local.md` - Store test configurations and results
- `api_integrations.local.md` - Store API integration configurations
- `performance_optimizations.local.md` - Track performance improvements

## üéØ Environment Preparation Workflow

### Step 1: Check for Existing Environment Configuration
**AI tools will first check for saved environment configuration:**
- Check if `env.local.md` exists in the magento-ai-agent-prompts repository root
- If found, read and parse the configuration file
- Use stored environment information for all operations
- Skip environment setup if configuration is complete and valid

### Step 2: üö® MANDATORY - Ask Human for Environment Paths
**AI tools MUST ALWAYS ask the human for PHP and Composer paths FIRST:**
- **NEVER attempt auto-detection without asking the human first**
- **ALWAYS request these two critical pieces of information:**
  - **PHP Path**: Ask human to provide the PHP executable path
  - **Composer Path**: Ask human to provide the Composer executable path
- **Only proceed with auto-detection if human explicitly cannot provide the paths**

### Step 3: üö® MANDATORY - Version Validation
**AI tools MUST validate PHP and Composer versions before proceeding:**

**üö® CRITICAL: Version Matching Requirements**
- **If user provides specific version requirements**: PHP and Composer versions MUST match exactly
- **If versions don't match**: STOP and ask user to provide correct versions
- **If tools don't exist in terminal environment**: STOP and ask user to install/configure them
- **NEVER continue with mismatched or missing versions**

**Version Validation Process:**
1. **Check if PHP exists at provided path**: `{php_path} --version`
2. **Check if Composer exists at provided path**: `{composer_path} --version`
3. **Extract actual versions** from command output
4. **Compare with user requirements** (if provided)
5. **If mismatch found**: STOP and request correct versions
6. **If tools missing**: STOP and request installation/configuration

**üö® MANDATORY STOP Conditions:**
- PHP executable not found at provided path
- Composer executable not found at provided path
- PHP version doesn't match user requirements
- Composer version doesn't match user requirements
- Any critical tool missing from terminal environment

### Step 4: Environment Setup Options
**AI tools MUST ALWAYS ask the human for PHP and Composer paths FIRST before any auto-detection:**

**üö® MANDATORY: Ask Human First**
- **ALWAYS ask the human to provide PHP and Composer paths before attempting any auto-detection**
- **Request these two essential pieces from the human:**
  - **PHP Path**: [e.g., /usr/bin/php, /opt/homebrew/bin/php] (will reveal PHP version)
  - **Composer Path**: [e.g., /usr/local/bin/composer, /opt/homebrew/bin/composer] (will reveal Composer version)

**Option 1: Manual Configuration (Recommended)**
- Human provides the two critical environment details directly for maximum accuracy
- **Use the paths provided by the human**
- **Verify the paths work correctly**

**Option 2: Auto-Detection (Only if human cannot provide paths)**
- **ONLY attempt auto-detection if the human explicitly cannot provide the paths**
- **ALWAYS ask first - never auto-detect without asking**
- May not be 100% accurate but provides a starting point
- **Focus only on detecting:**
  - PHP path and version
  - Composer path and version

### Step 5: Save Configuration (With User Consent)
**AI tools will save the configuration only after user consent:**
- Save to `env.local.md` in the **magento-ai-agent-prompts repository root directory**
- Include PHP and Composer paths/versions in structured markdown format
- Add metadata and usage instructions
- **Leave other environment fields as "Unknown" or "To be discovered"**

### Step 6: Dynamic Environment Discovery During Tasks
**AI tools will discover and update environment information during task execution:**
- **Magento Version**: Discover when running `php bin/magento --version`
- **Magento Mode**: Discover when running `php bin/magento deploy:mode:show`
- **Git Info**: Discover when running git commands
- **Project Path**: Discover from current working directory
- **Other Tools**: Discover Node.js, npm, Docker, etc. when needed
- **Update env.local.md** whenever new environment information is discovered
