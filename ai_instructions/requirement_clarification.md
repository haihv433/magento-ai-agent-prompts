# üéØ MANDATORY: AI Tool Requirement Clarification

## üö® CRITICAL: READ THIS FILE FIRST
**BEFORE executing ANY task, you MUST ensure requirements are clear, specific, and actionable. This prevents wasted effort, incorrect implementations, and ensures successful task completion.**

---

## üìã Purpose
This file instructs AI tools to systematically clarify ambiguous, abstract, or unclear human requirements before proceeding with any development task. This ensures proper scope definition, prevents misunderstandings, and leads to successful task completion.

**Key Benefits:**
- **Prevent Scope Creep**: Clarify requirements to avoid expanding beyond intended scope
- **Reduce Rework**: Get clear requirements upfront to avoid multiple iterations
- **Improve Accuracy**: Understand exactly what the user wants before implementation
- **Save Time**: Address ambiguity early rather than during development
- **Ensure Success**: Clear requirements lead to successful task completion

## üîç Requirement Analysis Process

### Step 1: Identify Requirement Types
**AI tools should categorize the requirement type:**

```
üîç **Requirement Analysis**

I've identified your request as one of the following types:

**‚úÖ Clear & Specific**: Detailed, actionable requirements with specific goals
**‚ö†Ô∏è Abstract**: High-level concepts without specific implementation details
**‚ùì Ambiguous**: Multiple possible interpretations or unclear objectives
**üîÑ Vague**: Missing critical details like scope, context, or constraints
**üìã Complex**: Multiple requirements combined or interdependent tasks

**Current Assessment**: [Type identified]
```

### Step 2: Clarification Questions by Type

#### **For Abstract Requirements:**
```
üéØ **Clarification Needed - Abstract Requirement**

Your request is quite abstract. To provide the best solution, I need to understand:

**Scope & Context:**
- What specific Magento functionality are you trying to achieve?
- Which part of your Magento store is affected?
- Is this for frontend, backend, or both?

**Implementation Details:**
- Do you have a specific approach in mind?
- Are there any existing modules or code to work with?
- What Magento version are you using?

**Success Criteria:**
- How will you know when this is working correctly?
- What should the end result look like?
- Are there any specific requirements or constraints?

**Priority & Timeline:**
- How urgent is this requirement?
- Are there any deadlines or dependencies?
```

#### **For Ambiguous Requirements:**
```
üéØ **Clarification Needed - Ambiguous Requirement**

Your request could be interpreted in several ways. Let me clarify:

**Specific Functionality:**
- Could you provide a concrete example of what you want to achieve?
- Are you referring to [Option A] or [Option B] or something else?
- What specific behavior are you looking for?

**Technical Context:**
- Which Magento components are involved?
- Are you working with existing code or creating something new?
- What's the current state vs. desired state?

**User Experience:**
- How should this work from a user's perspective?
- What should happen when [specific scenario]?
- Are there any error conditions to handle?

**Integration Points:**
- Does this need to work with other systems or modules?
- Are there any API integrations required?
- What data sources are involved?
```

#### **For Vague Requirements:**
```
üéØ **Clarification Needed - Vague Requirement**

Your request is missing some important details. I need to understand:

**Missing Context:**
- What specific problem are you trying to solve?
- What's the current situation that needs improvement?
- What triggered this requirement?

**Missing Scope:**
- Which parts of your Magento installation are affected?
- Are we talking about a specific page, module, or the entire system?
- What's the scale of this change?

**Missing Constraints:**
- Are there any performance requirements?
- Any compatibility requirements with existing code?
- Any security considerations?

**Missing Success Metrics:**
- How will you measure success?
- What's the expected outcome?
- Any specific performance targets?
```

#### **For Complex Requirements:**
```
üéØ **Clarification Needed - Complex Requirement**

Your request involves multiple components. Let me break this down:

**Component Breakdown:**
- [List identified components]
- Which component should we tackle first?
- Are these components independent or interdependent?

**Priority & Dependencies:**
- What's the most critical part to address first?
- Are there any dependencies between components?
- What's the logical order of implementation?

**Scope Management:**
- Should we implement all components at once or incrementally?
- Are there any components that can be simplified or deferred?
- What's the minimum viable solution?

**Resource Considerations:**
- How much time can you allocate to this?
- Are there any technical constraints I should know about?
- Any existing code or modules to work with?
```

3. **Identify missing information** based on the category

### **Step 2: Ask Targeted Questions**
1. **Use the appropriate question template** based on requirement type
2. **Ask 3-5 specific questions** to narrow down the scope
3. **Focus on the most critical missing information** first

### **Step 3: Refine Understanding**
1. **Listen to user responses** carefully
2. **Ask follow-up questions** if needed
3. **Confirm understanding** before proceeding

### **Step 4: Scope Definition**
1. **Summarize the clarified requirements**
2. **Define clear success criteria**

- ‚ùå **Proceed without user confirmation** of clarified requirements

### **Do:**
- ‚úÖ **Always assess requirement clarity** before proceeding
- ‚úÖ **Ask targeted, specific questions** to narrow scope

## üîÑ Integration with Other Instructions

**This clarification process should be used:**
- **Before** reading environment preparation instructions
- **Before** executing any prompt from the `/prompts/` folder
- **Before** applying any systematic approach from the `/magento/` folder
- **Throughout** the development process when new requirements emerge

**Remember**: Clear requirements lead to successful implementations. Always clarify before you code!
